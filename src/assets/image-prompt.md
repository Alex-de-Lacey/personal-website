Transform this image into a high-quality vector art illustration. Emphasize a clean, modern vector style using flat, solid-color fills and smooth, geometric forms. Define the subject with precise, consistently weighted contour lines that subtly vary to retain natural facial proportions and distinct feature shapes. Make the image look quite realestic. Apply a color palette that matches the original image colors. Strictly avoid gradients, textures, or noise. Ensure all edges are crisp and anti- aliased, with a polished, professional finish suitable for editorial digital illustrations.
